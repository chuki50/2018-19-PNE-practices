We are using the HTTP protocol. The web server has information that can be requested.
It responds with HTML, text, images, etc.
It is information for the using, but there are also data that is only available for the applications.
The format in which this data is stored is JSON.
There are 2 types of clients:
    - Browser: ask the web server for info HTTP
    - Python Client: ask for info HTTP from the database.
