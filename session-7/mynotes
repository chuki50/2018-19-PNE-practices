The client and the server are connected through the internet (wireless).
Many isolated computers are connected to each other through the internet. They are subdivided in networks.
We can identify the machine through the network interface, which has an IP address.
The IP address changes when you change network.

ifconfig
ip cellphone: 10.0.54.72
ip lab computer 212.128.253.64 time = 0.064 ms
time w/ other = 0.548 ms
